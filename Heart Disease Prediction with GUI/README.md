Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 

According to the World Health Organization, every year 12 million deaths
occur worldwide due to Heart Disease. Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of
morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of
cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section
of data analysis. The load of cardiovascular disease is rapidly increasing all over the
world from the past few years. 

Heart Disease is even highlighted as a silent killer which leads to the
death of the person without obvious symptoms. The early diagnosis of heart disease
plays a vital role in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in
turn reduces the complications.

Machine learning proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and
predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the health care industry. This
project aims to predict future Heart Disease by analyzing data of patients which
classifies whether they have heart disease or not using machine-learning algorithm.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
